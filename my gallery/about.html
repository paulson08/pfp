            my goals, my ambition</span>. basically i was struggling to decide my further studies. at this point <span>COVID</span> pandamic also started and I 
        was <span>stucked</span> in my native and unfortunatly i Choose to <span>BCA</span> (bachelor in computer application) and after also i was not serious... 
    and because of I am from <span>NON-IT</span> background i had zero basic knowledge and finally after completing my <span>Degree</span> I am Working on my skils 
under <span>JAVA Programing</span>. Now my HTML and CSS skills are improving and Getting to know some function's and program from C language. 
    That sparked an interest in programming for me.<br><br>Now, a few things about <span>myself</span>.<br>I love <span>pets</span> specially dogs,nature and learning new skills.
I have a <span>cat</span>, Molly and her daughter micky. she is a persian breed. I am still human so I still like activies like spending some <span>time</span> with some homies.
My <span>favourite</span> activity would probably be going to <span>gym</span> and hit some workout. </h3>
